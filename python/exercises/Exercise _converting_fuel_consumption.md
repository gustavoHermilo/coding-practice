# Fuel Consumption Conversion

This exercise implements two functions to convert fuel consumption units
between **liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km)** and **miles per gallon (MPG)**.

## Description

Fuel consumption is commonly expressed in different units depending on the region.
This program provides a simple and clear way to convert between:

- Liters per 100 kilometers → Miles per gallon
- Miles per gallon → Liters per 100 kilometers

The calculations are based on standard conversion constants:
- 1 mile = 1609.344 meters
- 1 US gallon = 3.785411784 liters

## Implemented Functions

### `liters_100km_to_miles_gallon(liters)`
Converts fuel consumption from **liters per 100 km** to **miles per gallon (MPG)**.

### `miles_gallon_to_liters_100km(miles)`
Converts fuel consumption from **miles per gallon (MPG)** to **liters per 100 km**.

## Concepts Practiced
