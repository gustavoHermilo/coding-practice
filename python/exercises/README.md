# Python Exercises

This folder contains Python exercises completed as part of my programming
learning process.

The exercises focus on strengthening fundamental programming skills through
small, self-contained problems and real-world inspired calculations.

## Topics Covered

- Variables and data types
- Conditional logic
- Loops
- Functions
- Mathematical operations
- Unit conversions
- Problem solving

## Structure

Each file in this folder represents an independent exercise.
Some exercises include additional documentation explaining the problem,
the approach taken, and the concepts practiced.

Example topics include:
- Fuel consumption unit conversion
- Basic algorithmic logic
- Practice with functions and calculations

## Purpose

The goal of this folder is to:
- Build strong foundations in Python
- Practice writing clean and readable code
- Improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills
- Maintain consistent learning activity in GitHub

These exercises serve as preparation for more advanced projects and
Software Engineering internship opportunities.

## Notes

- Code is written with clarity and readability in mind
- Comments are included where helpful to explain the logic
- Exercises may be refactored or improved as my skills grow
